This is a java version of the popular mouse wiggling app called "Caffeine".

I made this because I couldn't get the 'official' Caffeine app to work on Arch. I'm an inexperienced hobbyist (not even) programmer who is currently learning Java to be able to make Minecraft server plugins. Please don't judge :). Feel free to rec any changes that I should make by sending me a message.

If you like the program and it works well for you, I'm glad.

Enjoy! :)
